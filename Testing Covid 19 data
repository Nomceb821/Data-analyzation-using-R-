#that the ages of the two populations are equal
# Since the p-value < 0.05 we reject the null hypothesis 
#This concludes that our results are statistically significant 
#In this case we have concluded that indeed people who are more likely to die 
#from Covid are much older people than the people who do not die from Cov
